This is a game that aims to achieve a 3D sandbox environment where players can spawn in vegetation and animals and watch the animals show realistic behaviours suitable to their species and surroundings.

The game world is procedurally generated with a seed using a perlin noise algorithm and vegetation such as trees and grass are randomly placed on it. There is a script that allows grass and trees spread as well.


Made in Unity 2022.3
